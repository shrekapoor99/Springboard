### 		**		Project Capstone Ideas:**

### **1\. Analyzing NGO Rhetoric to Influence UN Policy on Environmental and Social Issues**

* **Problem Statement**: NGOs play a vital role in shaping the policy decisions of international organizations like the UN, particularly in the areas of environmental, social, and foreign policy. The project will analyze the rhetorical, deliberative, and argumentative strategies employed by NGOs to influence the UN Human Rights Council and evaluate their effectiveness over time, geographic location, and issue categories.  
* **Context**: International organizations such as the UN rely heavily on input from NGOs to shape policy, yet the mechanisms through which NGOs influence these policies are not fully understood. Understanding how NGOs frame issues and shift discourse is crucial for both NGOs and policymakers to better address global challenges.  
* **Criteria for Success**: Success is defined by the ability to identify patterns in the rhetorical strategies used by NGOs and their effectiveness in influencing UN policy over time. The project should provide insights into the key mechanisms that enable NGOs to shift policy discourse and decision-making.  
* **Scope of Solution Space**: The focus will be on analyzing NGO documents and communications with the UN over a set period (e.g., the last 30 years), with a particular emphasis on regional variations and key policy areas such as environment, development, and defense.  
* **Constraints**: The primary constraint is the availability of a representative sample of NGO documents over time and across regions. Access to certain UN datasets and potential restrictions on specific NGO communications might also limit the scope of the analysis.  
* **Stakeholders**: The primary stakeholders include UN administrative staff responsible for policy framing, NGOs aiming to influence international policy, and other international bodies such as UNESCO or the World Bank.  
* **Data Sources**: The project will utilize a text corpus of NGO documents from the UN Library, sourced via API access. This corpus will be stratified by time period, region, and policy area to allow for comprehensive analysis.

### **2\. Rhetorical Strategies in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reports: Analyzing Environmental and Social Commitments**

* **Problem Statement**: Corporations use CSR reports to demonstrate their commitment to environmental and social responsibility, but the rhetorical strategies used to frame these commitments vary across industries and regions. This project will analyze how corporations use language to shape public perception of their environmental and social efforts, and how these strategies have evolved in response to external pressures such as regulatory changes and environmental crises.  
* **Context**: In an era where corporate accountability is becoming more important to consumers and regulators alike, companies face increasing pressure to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. CSR reports are key tools used by corporations to shape public perception and protect their reputations.  
* **Criteria for Success**: Success will be defined by the ability to classify and compare rhetorical strategies used in CSR reports across different industries and regions, and to identify trends over time. The analysis should reveal how corporations respond to external pressures and shifts in public expectations.  
* **Scope of Solution Space**: The project will focus on a range of industries (e.g., technology, energy, retail) and regions, using CSR reports published over the past 20 years. This will allow for the identification of both industry-specific and global trends.  
* **Constraints**: The availability of CSR reports across all industries and regions may limit the dataset. Additionally, the diversity in report structure and language usage across corporations may pose challenges for standardizing the analysis.  
* **Stakeholders**: The key stakeholders include corporate executives responsible for sustainability initiatives, policymakers seeking to enforce environmental regulations, and consumers demanding greater transparency from corporations.  
* **Data Sources**: The dataset will consist of CSR reports from various multinational corporations, collected from public sources and sustainability reporting platforms. The data will be categorized by industry and year for comparative analysis.

### **3\. Investigating the Role of Social Movements in Shaping Public Health Policy through Rhetorical Analysis**

* **Problem Statement**: Social movements advocating for public health reforms use rhetorical strategies to influence public opinion and shape policy. This project will explore how different health-related social movements (e.g., mental health awareness, pandemic preparedness) frame their causes and how these strategies contribute to shifts in public health policy.  
* **Context**: Public health is a critical issue worldwide, and social movements play a key role in driving policy changes by raising awareness and pushing for reforms. Understanding how these movements frame their messages can provide insight into their influence on health policy outcomes.  
* **Criteria for Success**: The project will be successful if it can identify the key rhetorical techniques used by social movements and demonstrate how these techniques correlate with policy changes in public health. The findings should offer actionable insights into how social movements can effectively advocate for their causes.  
* **Scope of Solution Space**: The project will examine multiple health-related movements, focusing on their public communications (e.g., campaigns, speeches, media content) over the past decade. The analysis will compare strategies across different health issues (e.g., mental health vs. infectious diseases) and geographic regions.  
* **Constraints**: Data availability may be limited for smaller, grassroots movements. Additionally, varying levels of media coverage for different movements could affect the depth of the analysis.  
* **Stakeholders**: Stakeholders include public health organizations, policymakers involved in health reform, social movement leaders, and the general public who are influenced by these movements.  
* **Data Sources**: Data will consist of public communications from health-related social movements, including press releases, social media campaigns, and news articles. The data will be sourced from online databases and media outlets.
